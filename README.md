# VueJs practise project with Slack

This app is a simple matching game. 

It uses the Slack API to pull names and faces of your Slack teammates to help you learn their names.

### To get it working

You will need to set the token in the index.js file (see data.token).

How to get a Slack token: https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens

### Important Note

To run this in a non-development environment, you need to user oauth, not a test token. See Slack doumentation here: https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth
